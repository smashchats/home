        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Last updated: 2025.04.18</strong></p>

        <p>
            At <strong>Smashchats</strong>, your privacy is not just a feature — it's a foundational principle.
            Our app and protocols are built from the ground up to ensure that <strong>you own your data</strong>, not
            us.
            This privacy policy explains what limited data we collect (if any), how we handle it, and how our
            decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture protects your personal information.
        </p>

        <h3>🛡️ Core Privacy Principles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We can’t read your messages:</strong> All communication is <strong>end-to-end
                    encrypted</strong>. Only you and your intended recipients can decrypt your messages. We never have
                access.</li>
            <li><strong>We don’t run your servers:</strong> Smashchats is a decentralized client. Like an email client,
                you connect to servers you control or trust. You bring your own credentials and infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>We don’t store user data:</strong> We don’t manage your identity, messages, or content. Your
                data lives on your device and/or the servers you choose. We can’t access or track it.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics are strictly opt-in and anonymized:</strong> If you choose to help us improve the app,
                we may collect <em>anonymous usage data</em> like app crashes, load times, or feature usage. No
                identifiable information is collected or stored.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📊 Optional Analytics</h3>
        <p>If you <strong>opt in</strong>, we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type and OS (for UI compatibility)</li>
            <li>Anonymous usage patterns (e.g., feature usage frequency)</li>
            <li>Crash logs (to fix bugs faster)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We do not collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP addresses</li>
            <li>Message content</li>
            <li>Usernames or contact lists</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Analytics are handled using <em>privacy-focused tools</em> and stored without any personal identifiers. You
            can <strong>opt out</strong> at any time in the app settings.</p>

        <h3>🔐 Smash Identity & Neighborhoods</h3>
        <p>Your <strong>Smash identity</strong> is created and stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device. It is
            never sent to us.</p>
        <p>When you join a <strong>neighborhood</strong>, you’re interacting with that neighborhood’s infrastructure,
            not ours. Each neighborhood may have its own privacy practices — please review those independently.</p>

        <h3>👥 Third-Party Servers</h3>
        <p>Because Smashchats is a client, your data may interact with <strong>servers or infrastructure</strong> you or
            your community choose. These third parties are <em>not under our control</em>, and you are responsible for
            selecting trusted providers.</p>
        <p>We recommend using self-hosted or vetted community servers aligned with your privacy needs.</p>

        <h3>🔧 Developer Contributions</h3>
        <p>If you contribute to <strong>Smashchats</strong> or related protocols:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We may retain your GitHub username or email for collaboration and credit purposes</li>
            <li>Contributions to public repositories are, by nature, public</li>
            <li>Internal discussions in the Smash Developers neighborhood are visible to members</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All contributor data is used solely for coordination, versioning, and access control within development
            processes.</p>
