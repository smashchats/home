        <h2>Child Safety Standards</h2>

        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025.04.18</p>

        <p>At SmashChats, we take the safety of our users seriously — especially minors. Our systems are designed to
            ensure privacy, security, and responsible communication.</p>

        <h3>Our Policy Against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</h3>
        <p>We have zero tolerance for any form of child sexual abuse, exploitation, grooming, or harassment. Our app is
            built on peer-to-peer communication principles with no centralized message storage, but we implement several
            safeguards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All content is end-to-end encrypted by default.</li>
            <li>We do not store user messages or media on centralized servers.</li>
            <li>Users can report abusive behavior directly in-app or by emailing <a
                    href="mailto:safety@yourdomain.com">safety@yourdomain.com</a>.</li>
            <li>We investigate and escalate CSAE reports to relevant authorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In-App Reporting</h3>
        <p>Users can report any safety concerns directly from the app interface. Reports are sent securely to our safety
            team for review and action.</p>

        <h3>Compliance With Child Safety Laws</h3>
        <p>We comply with all relevant child protection laws and cooperate with regional and national authorities. This
            includes reporting to national hotlines and law enforcement when necessary.</p>

        <h3>Reporting and Contact</h3>
        <p>If you have a concern to report, please contact our child safety officer at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email: <a href="mailto:safety@yourdomain.com">safety@yourdomain.com</a></li>
            <li>Role: Designated Child Safety Point of Contact</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We review all child safety reports promptly and work with appropriate organizations to ensure a safe digital
            environment.</p>

        <h3>External Guidelines and References</h3>
        <p>We follow best practices as outlined by:</p>
