        Here, we are (re) defining the free web for communities. We are extending and combining open standards and
        open-source components to build the best end-to-end social application.<br><br>

        Our core values are:<br>

        <ul>
            <li>Privacy</li>
            <li>Safety</li>
            <li>Quality</li>

        <b>Smash is an open protocol</b>, and Smashchats is just a client. 
        You own your data and you can communicate with your contacts peer to peer, without any intermediary. 
        <br><br>

        <b>With your Smash identity</b>, you can join as many <b>neighborhoods</b> as you want. 
        Like in the real world digital neighborhoods are where individuals meet and can form communities, online. 
        <b>Neighborhoods</b>, as entities, do play the role of an intermediary when it comes to verifying, 
        connecting, and curating people and content, but once you are connected all communications can happen directly. 
        <br><br>

        <b>Smash is a 1:N messaging and a curated content sharing protocol.</b>
        We are designing a new standard combining open solutions and APIs to run a free digital social world. 
        Each function is standardized separately and ran in isolation as micro services. 
        As we promote full openness and interoperability, this means that the Smash protocol could be used for many other applications and use cases. 
        Effectively <b>redesigning the web for digital communities</b>.
        <br><br>

        Because the protocols we are using are open and modular, you can switch and join as many neighborhoods as
        you'd like. You can also build your own client; or you can expand the Smashchats app.
        <br><br>

        <b>For the same reasons it also means that, as in real life, there will be good and bad neighborhoods. We are no
        one to judge. Be careful out there and be kind to one another. Share recommendations!</b>
        <br><br>

        As the pioneers of this new internet, we will kickstart a few neighborhoods.
        <br><br>

        Our very first one is the <b>Smash Developers neighborhood</b>. 
        To join, you must contribute to the Smashchats app or one of the co-developed protocols 
        and apply for a (free) membership.
